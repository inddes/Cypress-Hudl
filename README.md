Following are the steps to run Cypress Project:

1.Install NodeJS on your machine.

2.Install VisualStudio Code on your machine (you can install any editor but I like VSCode most so chosen that)

3.Create a empty folder in your Local ex: "CypressProject".

4.Clone the repo from Github to above newly create folder "CypressProject".

5.Open "CypressProject" in VisualStudio code.

7.Open VisualStudio Code terminal navigate to the project folder and then type command "npm init".
